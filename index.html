                <p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for visiting Brandon Myhan’s portfolio page. We always appreciate more eyes on our projects and are grateful for any feedback in an effort to better serve you in the future. This website currently displays as a full demonstration of Brandon’s talents and is included but not limited to his scope of work which includes; Website Development. For those inquiring Brandon did earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from the California State University of Northridge within the Mike Curb School of Cinema and Television Arts with an emphasis in Screenwriting.  This emphasis is what he worked the hardest on and laboriously learned every marketable skill the screenwriting program had to offer and eagerly entered the workforce.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Brandon entered the entertainment industry in hopes to pitch his scripts but soon found himself reading stranger's scripts and helping other people with their own stories. He worked harder in hopes to get paid to make up stories and found himself moving from agency to studio to management company to make that happen. But alas, he found that he had drifted away from the screenplays and stories that drove him and instead was surrounded by suits, lawyers, and commercials. He needed a change. He tried to be a teacher, but one needs to love teaching to teach, and he did not love to teach. Then he tried the startup game and found he was good at the startup game. He had worked fast desks before and he had learned to tell stories and found those two married nicely in a place called, marketing.  He had written a novel in his spare time and decided to try his hand at the world of marketing. He self published the novel and quickly learned that people need to be able to see your marketing skills in order for them to work and in the 21st century that means building it on the internet.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Brandon has one more marketable skill he needs to acquire and he’ll be unstoppable. Once he completes his education he can use programs to send stories across the world!

                    In the meantime, if you or anyone you know has an opening at their company in need of any one of the skills listed above, please do not hesitate to contact me directly. Creating is an expensive endeavor and I’m always looking for sponsors.
